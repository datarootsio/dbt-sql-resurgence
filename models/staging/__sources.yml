          Trips made by New York City's iconic yellow taxis.
          Yellow taxis are the only vehicles permitted to respond to a street hail from a passenger in all five
          boroughs. They may also be hailed using an e-hail app like Curb or Arro.
          The records were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by
          technology service providers.
